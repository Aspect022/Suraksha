🚨 Suraksha – MVP Mobile App Prompt
Goal:
Build a React Native mobile app called Suraksha. This is an MVP for demo purposes, so UI/UX clarity is more important than fully working backend features. It should look professional, clean, and easy to demo, even if some features are mocked or simulated.

🌐 Tech Stack
React Native (Expo) for mobile development (cross-platform Android + iOS).

TypeScript for type safety.

Use Tailwind or simple styled-components for styling.

Use dummy/mock data where real sensors or APIs are not possible.

📱 App Overview
Suraksha continuously monitors user safety using:

🎤 Voice trigger detection (keyword “help”) + distress emotion (mocked for demo).

❤️ Heart rate (simulated from wearable).

📍 Location (use expo-location with mock fallback).

📊 Motion sensors (accelerometer/gyroscope via expo-sensors, mock if not available).

All signals feed into an AI Scoring Model (mocked) that decides whether to escalate.

🖌️ UI / UX Requirements
1. Onboarding & Permissions
First launch shows consent screen explaining app collects mic, location, motion, heart rate.

User must tap “I Agree & Continue” before proceeding.

2. Home Dashboard
Clean card-based layout with status indicators:

🎤 Voice: ✅ Active / ❌ Inactive

❤️ Heart Rate: e.g., “78 bpm” (simulate live values)

📍 Location: e.g., “12.34, 56.78”

📊 Motion: “Stable / Sudden Movement”

Large Start Monitoring / Stop Monitoring button in the center.

Subtle background animation (heartbeat pulse effect).

3. Alert Flow
When anomaly is detected (mock with a button for demo), trigger Stage 1 Alert Screen:

Full-screen alert: “Are you safe?”

Big buttons: ✅ “I Am Safe” / 🚨 “Need Help”

Countdown timer (10s).

If no response → go to Stage 2:

Show mock “Sending Location to Trusted Contacts…” with animated loader.

Show list of contacts with ✅ icons.

If still no response → Stage 3:

Show “Alerting Police…” screen.

Include details: time, location, anomaly type (voice/heart/motion).

4. Settings Screen
User profile (name, photo).

Add / edit trusted contacts (mock with simple list).

Toggle “High-Risk Mode” (increases sensitivity).

Dark mode switch.

🔧 Functionality (Mocked for MVP)
Voice Trigger: Simulate with a “Test Voice Trigger” button.

Heart Rate: Generate random BPM between 70–100 every few seconds.

Motion: Simulate “sudden shake” with button.

Location: Fetch once from expo-location, then show mock updates.

Fusion Model: Just random chance + button trigger for demo.

Escalation: UI-only flow, no real SMS/calls.

🎨 Styling Guidelines
Use calm, safe theme: primary color = teal/blue (#1B4D3E background, white cards).

Minimalist cards with icons for each sensor.

Rounded buttons with shadows, large and clear labels.

Animations:

Pulsing heart icon for heart rate.

Vibrating alert screen for emergencies.

🧪 Demo Script
Open app → onboarding consent screen.

Home dashboard shows live mock data (voice ✅, HR ❤️ 82 bpm, location 📍).

Press “Test Voice Trigger” → Stage 1 alert pops up.

Ignore alert → auto-escalates to Stage 2 (contacts notified).

Ignore again → Stage 3 (police alerted with details).

Open settings → show trusted contacts + dark mode toggle.

⚠️ Note: This MVP is for pitch/demo only. Features like real keyword detection, BLE heart rate, or police alerts are mocked with UI/UX flows.
